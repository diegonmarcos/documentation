Okay, I'm ready to help you manage your project backlogs. I've parsed your input and organized it into distinct projects with their associated tasks. Here's how I understand your current projects and their backlogs:

**Project: VM configuration SSH connection** 
* **Tags:** #Lecole 42 #B2B root 
* **Backlog:**
    * a) Investigate Virtualbox port forwarding: Determine if different ports are necessary for mapping and understand the reasons behind potential differences. Explore the possibility of using the same port and identify any limitations.
    * b) Analyze IP assignment for images: Understand how images acquire their IP addresses and investigate the reasons behind Guest/Host IP variations despite using the same network board.

**Project: Framework interpretation** 
* **Tags:** #Lecole 42 #General Project 
* **Backlog:**
    * a)  Develop a system for signal detection and unit testing to enable backtracking for proposition interpretation.
    * b)  Differentiate between signal interpretation and framework interpretation: Define the specific signals required for each and outline their respective purposes.

**Project: Job seeking** 
* **Tags:** #Career Development 
* **Backlog:**
    * a)  Identify companies and roles that align with your personal philosophy.  Consider the slower hiring pace in the EU/GER and prioritize companies that value safety and stability over rapid innovation.

**Project: DeutschKurs** 
* **Tags:** #Career Development 
* **Backlog:**
    * a)  Design and structure Vokabelinste (vocabulary learning) using a new model.
    * b)  **(This task needs further definition. Please provide more details.)**

**Project: IT Designing** 
* **Tags:** #Career Development #Lecole 42
* **Backlog:**
    * a)  Design an IT infrastructure including a VPS, cloud storage, an independent VPN, and virtual machines for Arch Linux, Windows, and macOS.


I'm ready for your updates or new tasks. Just tell me what you want to add, change, or remove, and I'll keep your project backlogs organized.  

For example, you could say:

* "Add to DeutschKurs:  b)  Practice speaking with a language partner for 30 minutes twice a week."
* "Remove from Job seeking: a) Identify companies..." 
* "Change IT Designing a) to:  Research different VPS providers and compare their pricing and features." 

Let's keep your projects on track!
